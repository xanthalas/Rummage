Red is the first colour
Yellow is the second colour
The third colour is Green
And the fourth one is Blue
Fifth is brown which is in lower case
And sixth is PURPLE which is in upper case
Now we have OranGe in mixed case in seventh
Next we have yellow again - in eigth this time
Brown a second time coming in ninth
Black is number ten
And last but not least White in eleventh
