0007: Load a saved search request. Tick the "Case-sensitive" option and start the search. It rescans all the folders before searching. Case-sensitive 
      might be a red-herring but it definitely shouldn't be re-reading the files.
0008: In the "Search where" box the program will crash if you enter the path to a DVD drive which is empty
0009: Adding an invalid regex into the "Files" filter causes the program to crash

Fixed
-----
0001: Incorrectly specified regex in file filter box (and possibly other filter boxes) causes crash.
0002: Changing the search location and then running a new search doesn't remove the previous search location so both old and new get searched.
0003: If the folder or search history files are corrupt it crashes the program.
0004: If you cancel a search during the "Determining which files to search" phase and then start a new search with the same folder(s)
      but different "search for" criteria it will go straight to searching the files it has found so far and won't restart from the beginning.
0005: Creating a new search doesn't reset the title in the title bar
0006: When the Search is completed the "Progress bar" should change to say "Done" or similar
