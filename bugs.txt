0006: When the Search is completed the "Progress bar" should change to say "Done" or similar
0007: When saving a previously-loaded search the title bar should update to show that it is now current

Fixed
-----
0001: Incorrectly specified regex in file filter box (and possibly other filter boxes) causes crash.
0002: Changing the search location and then running a new search doesn't remove the previous search location so both old and new get searched.
0003: If the folder or search history files are corrupt it crashes the program.
0004: If you cancel a search during the "Determining which files to search" phase and then start a new search with the same folder(s)
      but different "search for" criteria it will go straight to searching the files it has found so far and won't restart from the beginning.
0005: Creating a new search doesn't reset the title in the title bar
